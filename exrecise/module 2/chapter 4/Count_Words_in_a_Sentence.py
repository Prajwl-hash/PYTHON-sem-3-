# The line with 'unique_numbers' seems incomplete or incorrect. Assuming it's intended to be printed:
# print(unique_numbers)

# Closing curly brace '}' seems misplaced, removing it.

# Assuming 'data' is defined elsewhere in your code:
print(data["person"]["details"]["city"])  # Output: New York

# Assuming 'maximum' is defined earlier in the code:
print(maximum)
